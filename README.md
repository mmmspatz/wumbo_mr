# Wumbo MR
Free and Open Source support software for WMR devices.

## Background
I want to use my HP Reverb G2 to play _Half Life: Alyx_ on Linux. That means I need full software support for the headset and controllers, inside out head tracking, and controller tracking. So far, I have mostly just re-invented parts of [OpenHMD](https://github.com/OpenHMD/OpenHMD).

Check out [head_tracking](head_tracking/README.md) for the most exciting result so far.
